# ml-technical-analysis
machine learning technical analysis for equities

## Phase 1: ML-TA as a Platform
The goal is to build out a series of straight-forward technical analysis functions that can be used in ML functions. 

## Phase 2: ML Functions
The purpose of the ML functionality is to scale out the individual trader's ability to do analysis - both in terms of number of stocks analyzed and number of inidicators used.

## Phase 3: Backtesting and Paper Trading
create a data driven application for storing historical data for running tracking a user portfolio through paper trading. Major features of this system will be a very basic UI, perhaps spreadsheet based, and a backend database.

## Phase 4: New Data Sources
Incorporate new datasources that will differentiate the platform from competitors and simple TA systems

## Phase 5: Commercialize UI and Website
Create a user friendly version of the app on a hosted website
